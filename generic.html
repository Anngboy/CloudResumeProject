							<p>Hello there! If you've made it to this page, it means you want to know a little more about me and how I got here. I’ll try to make this short and sweet: I started this IT journey back when I was a young teen. I always loved playing video games, and one day, PlayStation’s network got hacked with no timeline of when things would be coming back. With all that downtime, I decided to start looking into computers. When I realized that my parents' computer from 1997 wouldn’t be able to run League of Legends, I thought it was time to build one myself.<br><br>

								And so it began. After watching a bunch of YouTube videos and spending a lot of time looking at sales for parts, I finally had everything purchased and ready to be put together. It took me all day, but there was no better feeling than the first time I hit the power button on my brand new PC… only for the power not to turn on because the power supply was off. BUT once that bad boy was on, we were cruising.<br>
								
								My passion has always been to help others, and as a young teen, I thought, what better job than to be a Police Officer. So, I went to Seneca College and pursued a career in law enforcement. I worked as a security guard and a security manager for the time being until COVID-19 hit. My progression on my police applications was put on hold. I looked for a different alternative for myself that would allow me to work even if people weren’t supposed to be in the same room. That’s when I thought to myself, “well, I like computers and I like security and law enforcement. Why not combine the two?”. After googling some career paths, I soon realized that the CompTIA A+ was going to be my best chance of getting my foot in the door with this career.<br><br>
								
								I studied for and passed the A+ tests and was officially certified. After numerous applications to anything that was remotely close to my ability, I was able to land a job at De La Salle College where I would go to learn and grow. It was there that I noticed that I liked working with IT tools and helping people out on a day-to-day basis. From here, I wanted to learn more and be able to grow with different companies in an enterprise environment. Which is where I am now! Working with MBC has opened up my ability to so many cool and different technologies and ways of solving problems.<br><br>
								
								While working with MBC, I was studying for the CompTIA Security + certification. I had read/watched that this was a great entry-level certification to get into a cybersecurity role. Fast forward to today and I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional course and I am Security + certified. Now is when the real fun begins. I have decided to further pursue this dream of getting into cybersecurity but for cloud services.
								
								As the trend is pushing for more and more cloud-oriented business, Azure and AWS are more popular than ever. I have decided to take on the AWS entry-level exam along with the Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal. This project will also come along with a blog in which I will be posting my journey, filled with successes, many failures, and most importantly, experience gained from working in the AWS Cloud.
								
								If you've made it this far, thank you. I can’t wait to see where this journey takes us, and I’m excited to have you be a part of it!
								
								Andy</p>
